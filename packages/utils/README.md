# @codemod/utils

This package contains utilities for writing codemods. Mostly it exists to enable
codemods to avoid depending on `@babel/types`, `@babel/core`, and others as well
as `@codemod/cli`.  It's easy to depend on incompatible versions of these
packages, so this package wraps them and exports a single version of each.

## Install

Install from [npm](https://npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install @codemod/core
```

## Usage

You can use this library directly, but typically it's provided by `@codemod/cli`
when defining a codemod with `defineCodemod`. Here's an example of using it
directly:

```ts
// `m` is `@codemod/matchers`, a library of useful matchers
// `t` is `@babel/types`, babel AST type predicates and builders
import { m, t } from '@codemod-esm/utils'
```
